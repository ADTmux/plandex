- Add support for new OpenAI models: `gpt-4-turbo` and `gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09` -- these models haven't been set as defaults yet since they need more testing, but can be used with the `set-model` command
- Fix for handling files that are loaded into context and later deleted from the file system (https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex/issues/47)
- Handle file paths with ### prefixes (https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex/issues/77)
